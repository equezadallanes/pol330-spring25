This will not only help you write more useful summaries, but it will also help you become a more intentional reader.\nA summary should help you or someone else understand the main points of the piece as well as some of its context. It should answer the following questions:\nI would argue that a good summary for a journal article can be short (~5 sentences) or a bit longer (three-quarters of a page), depending on the level of detail that is required. For this class, anything in between these two lengths will suffice. I care much more about the content of the summary than its length.",

We will begin by discussing Latine identity, identifying and describing the demographics of this population, and analyzing the extent to which Latines have politicized identities. We will then analyze historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and policies as well as Chicano social and labor movements. After that, we will discuss Latine political behavior, where we will cover Latine public opinion, partisan affiliations, voting patterns, and representation. We will finish the course by discussing the role of Latines in recent elections and the potential for multiracial and multiethnic coalitions."

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.\n\n\n\nCourse Expectations\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate during class discussions. This course has both a lecture and a discussion component. The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Readings can be accessed through the library resources or, when not available through the library, via Canvas.\n\nIf you do not have a subscription to The New York Times, please sign up through the school here: https://accessnyt.com/\n\n\n\nCourse Workload\nThis is a 4-credit hour course, meaning that you are expected to spend 12 hours of work each week (including the 3 hours spent in the classroom). This roughly means that you will spend about 2 hours on readings for each class period, and 3 hours each week working on the different assignments (pace yourself!).\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n&lt; 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (20%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have two unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that class period.\n\nWeekly summaries (20%): Each week for seven weeks, you will summarize one article from the week’s readings (the reading you can summarize has a  after it in the course schedule). There are 10 weeks in the semester where you can write a summary, so you can skip some weeks. It is up to you to decide which weeks to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font) and must include the full citation of the reading at the top of the page. These summaries must be submitted via Canvas before class time on the day the reading was assigned.\nResponse paper (10%): Students will write a response paper (2 double-spaced pages, 12-point font) where they integrate the readings for a given week. At the beginning of the semester, students will choose a week for their response paper. In the response paper, you will highlight the connections between the readings, write about their applicability to the role of Latines in American politics today, and offer a critique of the readings as a whole. You may choose to focus more on applicability to today or a critique of existing research. The response paper is due on the Friday of the chosen week.\nCampaign memo (15%): Students will write a campaign memo for a 2026 Senate campaign focused on a strategy for Latine outreach. Students must provide sufficient background on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies to appeal to Latine voters in their respective state. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\nResearch Design Paper (25% total): Students will propose a research design to answer a question of interest. This paper must include an introduction, a literature review that situates the present question in the broader field, an answer to the question (the argument/theory), and a proposed design to answer the question. Students should meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and think about how one might design a study to answer the question of interest. This paper will be broken down into different parts that will be due throughout the semester.\nOral Presentation (10%): Students will give an oral presentation based on research design paper. This will take the form of a conference presentation.\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized with one point off for each 24-hour period after the due date."

Passing off someone else’s work (or Chat GPT’s) as your own represents intellectual fraud and theft and violates the core values of our academic community. To be honorable, you should understand not only what counts as academic dishonesty, but also how to avoid engaging in these practices.\nYou are responsible for the content of any work submitted for this course. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a first draft of text is permitted, but you must review and revise any AI-generated text before submission. AI text generators can be useful tools but they are often prone to factual errors, incorrect or fabricated citations, and misinterpretations of abstract concepts.

    "text": "Task\nFor this first part of the research design paper, you must do two things:\n\nSubmit one paragraph (between 2 and 5 sentences) proposing a topic and research question for your final paper.\nSubmit a list of at least five peer-reviewed journal articles for your literature review.\n\n\nTopic and Research Question\nBriefly introduce the topic you are interested in and formulate a research question. Remember that research questions can take different forms. For example, you might see the following:\n\nWhat is the effect of x on y?\nWhy do some people (community or policy) do one thing and others do another thing?\nHow does x relate to y?\n\nScholars have different preferences for how a question is best formulated, and the same question can be reworked to fit several constructions. For example, in a co-authored project my colleagues and I ask, “do Hispanic voters care if a political candidate speaks to them in Spanish and does it matter how proficient the candidate sounds?” This two-part question fits both the first and third examples. If we knew that some Spanish-language appeals from candidates are more successful than others, we could have asked, “why are some Spanish-language appeals effective while others are not?” Now it looks more like the second example.\nWhatever construction you choose for now, think about what kind of answer there might be to your questions and why. Choose something that interests you and that you really want to know.\n\n\nList of Literature\nSubmit a list of at least five peer-reviewed journal articles1 for your literature review or final paper.\nThe goal is to help you get started on identifying the literature you need to engage with for your research project. By conducting research, you are entering a conversation with other academics, so you must be familiar with the ideas and findings that are already out there.",

Now, you have two keywords for your project that you can look up on an academic database (e.g., Google Scholar).\nExample: if I am interested on the relationship between national origin and partisanship among Latinos, I would want to search for “national origin,” “partisanship,” and “Latino.” I would try different combinations of these terms because you need to know the impact of national origin on different outcomes as well as the predictors of partisanship beyond national origin.",

It is, however, not a collection of summaries about each article (that would be an annotated bibliography). Instead, a literature review conveys what these works say together and identifies gaps in the literature. In other words, it shows what we know about something but also highlights what we don’t yet know.\nFor this assignment, provide an introduction to the literature review. Tell the reader why this topic is important and how you will approach it (i.e., “In this literature review, I will discuss X, Y, and Z”).",

You can use the following questions as a guide to evaluate the draft:\n\nDoes the memo provide clear takeaways on the first page?\nIs the purpose of the memo clear?\nDoes the memo describe the demographic characteristics of the state and of the Latine population?\nGiven the characteristics of the candidate, does the memo provide an answer to whether and how the candidate should reach out to potential voters?\nDoes the memo provide clear, actionable strategies for the campaign staff?\nDoes the memo use data and appropriately cite sources (e.g., using footnotes)?\nDoes the memo provide sufficient information without overwhelming the reader?\nDoes the memo’s organization help effectively communicate the main points?\nDoes the memo use headers in a clear way? Are the paragraphs single spaced? Is there space between paragraphs? Does the memo use lists and bullet points appropriately?\n\nYou can also ask these questions of your own work.
